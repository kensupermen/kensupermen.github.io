### 100-line classes

### Five lines per method
Five lines ensured that we never use else with elsif.
Having only one line per branch urged us to use well-named private methods to get work done.
Private methods are great documentation. They need very clear names, which forced us to think about the content of the code we were extracting.

### Four method arguments

### Only instantiate one object in the controller

If needed more than one type of thing on a page using the Facade Pattern.
