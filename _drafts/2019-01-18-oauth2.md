# Flow

Build site A that allows users to perform operations on site B
Site B provides an API that implements OAuth2.0 for authorization of my app.
Scheme:

- User `XXX` loads site A and clicks Login
- She redirected to site B's authorization page, where she either authenticates or has an active session.
- If she authorizes site A to access site B on her behalf, she is redirected back to site A with an authorization code
- Site A gets the authorization code and exchanges it for an access token (and a refresh token) through site B's API.
- Site A asks site B for Sally's user_id and logs her in with that ID
